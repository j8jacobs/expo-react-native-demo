# Welcome!

This application demos the state of React, React Native and Expo at this time (SDK 50), from the perspective I'm at as a developer with my patterns and preferences:

1. Expo Router
2. Jest Testing & Code Coverage
3. Animations
4. Expo MapView API

It leverages the Expo Router structure to create seperate modules to test different pieces in isolation. For example: Barhop is an app I made with friends that won a hackathon in 2017 - it uses the maps API and Yelp GraphQL API to find bars that fit your night's vibe and it stacks them in a sequences that deeplinks into your uber app to help you through the night. The whole app can be implemented within the /app/barhop module. Though it may become a standalone app one day, here it serves as a challenge to get the most functionality out of the fewest lines of code, in the most compact structure I can fit.

This will grow with time. Some features I intend to include are:

1. More writeups on different React/React Native/Expo/JS topics and other dev musings
2. Authentication
3. Visual appeal
4. 100% Code Coverage
